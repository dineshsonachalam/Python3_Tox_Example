### Tox
Tox - Its a generic virtual env management and command line that run tests in each environment.

To run tox you need to have two files:
1. tox.ini -> It is categorized into 3 components as tox(different version of python env), testenv(specify the dependencies or python packages that needed to be installed in each environment), commands(commands that needed to be executed in each env)
2. setup.py -> It helps us to install python packages similar to that of pip and easy_install.
